					<p>The most difficult part of graduate school is staying motivated. Spending 5 or more years on a project (PhD) or 2 years on a project (Masters) is not something that most students have done before. Up to this point, courses were generally semester or year long, and if you disliked one of them, you could slog through it. This is not true for graduate school. If you dislike what you do every day, you cannot slog through 2-5+ years of it. Instead, you will either slowly do less and less work, and fall more and more behind, or you will be immensely unhappy. Therefore, my biggest advice for graduate school is to find what style of working works best for you, and adapt your life so that you can do your work in that manner.
