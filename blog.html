					<h6>Reflect on what makes you engaged and productive
					<p>The most difficult part of graduate school is staying motivated. Spending 5 or more years on a project (PhD) or 2 years on a project (Masters) is not something that most students have done before. Up to this point, courses were generally semester or year long, and if you disliked one of them, you could slog through it. This is not true for graduate school. If you dislike what you do every day, you cannot slog through 2-5+ years of it. Instead, you will either slowly do less and less work, and fall more and more behind, or you will be immensely unhappy. Therefore, my biggest advice for graduate school is to find what style of working works best for you, and adapt your life so that you can do your work in that manner. For example, I work best in the mornings, and by doing work every day (Monday - Friday). With this in mind, I try to schedule my most important taks for the morning, and I get to my office by 9 am most days. However, you might work best in the evenings, and prefer to work very long hours a few days a week and short hours the other days. There is nothing wrong with that. Plan to do your most important work (research, writing, committee meetings) at times that align as best as possible with the times you are productive. And don't feel like you are doing something "wrong" if someone else gets to the office earlier than you, or stays later. As long as your working style works for YOU, it is a good working style.
