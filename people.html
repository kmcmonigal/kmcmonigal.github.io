								<h2 style="color:white;">Dr. Kay McMonigal (he/him or they/them)</h2>
								<p style="color:white;">Dr. McMonigal is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He grew up in Tacoma, Washington, received a BA from Northwestern University in Chicago, and a PhD from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami. His PhD focused on combining different types of ocean observational data to estimate a time varying heat budget of the Indian Ocean. Dr. McMonigal's postdoctoral training was at NC State University, working with Dr. Sarah Larson. This work focused on using models to determine the role of changes in the wind driven ocean circulaton onto historical and projected climate change. He is now interested in combining models and observations, to better improve estimates of global and Arctic climate change. He is also committed to improving diversity in oceanography. One key focus is improving the experiences of underrepresented people on research vessels. See a recent publication on experiences of transgender scientists at sea <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023AV000927">here</a>.</p>

								<h2 style="color:white;">Jaclyn Beight (she/her)</h2>
								<p style="color:white;">Starting August 2023, Jackie started as a PhD student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks under Dr. Kay McMonigal. She grew up in rural Indiana where she earned her BS in Biology (Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental) from Purdue University. After working in livestock nutrient for 5 years, she returned to school to earn her MA in Marine Science from Jacksonville University. Her research interests center around the intersection of physical oceanography and climate change. She is currently studying Bering Strait transport predictions using climate models. She is also invested in sharing her knowledge to the general public.</p>

								<h2 style="color:white;">Ava Meier</h2>
								<p style="color:white;">Ava started as a master's student under Dr. Kay McMonigal at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in the Fall of 2024. She grew up just outside Atlanta, Georgia, and earned her BS in Ocean Science from the University of Georgia in 2023. Upon graduation, she conducted ecological surveys across coastal Georgia as a Seasonal Wetlands Technician for the GA Department of Natural Resources. Her research interests involve understanding how climate change impacts oceanic processes and ecosystems through the lens of physical oceanography. She is currently studying turbulent nitrate fluxes in the Northern Gulf of Alaska.</p>

								<h2 style="color:white;">Khrista Nicholas (she/her)</h2>
								<p style="color:white;">Khrista began working with Dr. McMonigal as a Master's student in Fall of 2025. Born in South Florida with Caribbean roots, she is motivated by her communities' proximity to the ocean to understand marine processes. She received her B.S. in Marine Science and Biology from the University of Miami where her research focused on marine invertebrate physiology and their resilience to climate change. Khrista had questions about the physical environment that marine organisms experience, so she decided to pursue a Master’s in Oceanography. Here at UAF, she is studying trends in Agulhas Current transport, especially as it relates to global circulation and regional community impacts. She is excited to bridge the gap between dynamic oceanography and the ecophysiology of marine organisms. Although she is not currently studying Arctic systems, Khrista is passionate about science communication to connect with local communities and those impacted by her research.</p>

								<h2 style="color:white;">Kylie Wells</h2>
								<p style="color:white;">Kylie joined Dr. McMonigal’s lab at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as a Master’s student in the Fall of 2025. Born and raised in Maryland, Kylie earned her BS in Marine Science from St. Mary’s College of Maryland. During undergrad studies, her work focused largely on planktonic communities and bioluminescent dinoflagellates. She worked to develop an accessible method for citizen scientists to survey bioluminescing HABs in the Chesapeake Bay. She also has prior research experience with the Navy trying to quantify and understand microscale turbulence using optical imaging techniques. She is continuing this research at UAF and developing a method for quantifying turbulence with shadowgraphs.</p>

								<h2 style="color:white;">Medea Ramnath-Christiansen (it/its)</h2>
								<p style="color:white;">Medea began as an undergraduate in Dr. McMonigal's lab in January 2026. Arriving from a 13 year NYC career as a professional concert dancer and circus acrobat, Medea is in a transition to physical oceanography to study deep ocean circulation with the hope to help mitigate microplastic hotspots. Medea is grateful to be in an incredible learning environment while assisting with scientific communications about the ACTION Project's 2025 Convergence Cruise on the R/V Sikuliaq and working on wave buoy construction. Medea is committed to citizen education, fusing the arts and science to communicate its future studies in digestible ways.</p>
