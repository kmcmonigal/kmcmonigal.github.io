								<h2>Agulhas System Climate Array cruise 2016</h2>
								<p>My PhD focused on estimating a time series of South Indian Ocean heat transport from observations. To do this, we used mooring data from the Agulhas System Climate Array <a href="https://beal-agulhas.rsmas.miami.edu/research/projects/asca/index.html">(ASCA)</a>, as well as Argo and satellite sea surface height. As part of this work, I joined research cruises in the Agulhas Current in April 2016 and June 2018. A presentation of the data from the ASCA mooring array is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDqQPv0bE7c&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>
